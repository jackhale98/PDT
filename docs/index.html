// FEATURES
Built for Engineering Teams
Everything you need to manage complex product development in plain text.
```

Plain-Text YAML
Human-readable files that diff beautifully in git. No proprietary formats, no vendor lock-in. Your data stays yours forever.

Schema Validation
JSON Schema validation with beautiful error messages. Line numbers, context, and actionable suggestions for every issue.

Full Traceability
Link requirements to tests, risks to mitigations. Generate traceability matrices and find orphaned entities instantly.

FMEA Risk Management
Built-in Failure Mode and Effects Analysis. Track severity, occurrence, detection ratings. Auto-calculate RPN and risk levels.

Short ID Aliases
Use REQ@1, RISK@2 instead of 26-character ULIDs. Persistent, cross-entity linking that just works.

Tolerance Analysis
Features, mates, and stackups with worst-case, RSS, and Monte Carlo analysis. Built for mechanical engineering.
